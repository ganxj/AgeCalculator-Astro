## The Impact of Lifestyle Choices on Health and Longevity

A healthy lifestyle can significantly prolong lifespan and improve quality of life. Many scientific studies have demonstrated that good nutrition, regular exercise, weight control and other healthy habits can help the human body maintain higher functioning, resist diseases and aging, and achieve health and longevity.

## Sufficient and Balanced Nutrition

Vegetables and fruits are important sources of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals for the body's anti-disease functions. Research from the Chinese Nutrition Society shows that consuming more than 400g of vegetables and fruits per day can significantly reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. At the same time, a diet structure that is low in sugar, fat and high in dietary fiber is also important. According to data from American epidemiological studies, this type of dietary pattern can extend life expectancy by 2-3 years compared to a regular diet.

## Regular Exercise

Habitual exercise can promote cardiovascular function, strengthen muscles and bones, and accelerate metabolism. Studies show that 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week can reduce the risk of death by 30% compared to complete lack of exercise. Exercise also helps relieve stress and anxiety.

## Weight Control

A normal weight can reduce the risks of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other conditions. A body mass index over 30 kg/m2 increases the mortality risk by over 30% compared to a normal weight. Daily moderate exercise and balanced nutrition can effectively control weight.

## Other Healthy Lifestyle Habits

Adequate sleep, moderate drinking, stress relief and regular checkups are also closely related to healthy sleep and disease prevention. Canadian research data shows a correlation between these lifestyle habits and longevity.

## Case Studies to Inspire Us

Common traits among many long-lived people often involve consistently healthy lifestyles, such as the Blue Zone diet and Japanese longevity diet. Studies have also found significant life extension effects from the Mediterranean diet.
